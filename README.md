I've been keeping a running list of highly recommended and informative resources that I have come across while learning more about robotics. The majority of these resources are free at least to audit, see note at the bottom about Coursera courses. For any resources that are not free - mostly books - I've added a (paid) label.

#### Contributing
I hope you find these resources useful as well and if you have any to add that I'm missing please email me at [duncan@rosecityrobotics.com](mailto:duncan@rosecityrobotics.com) or submit a PR to update the [source code](https://github.com/duncantmiller/ai-robotics-resources/blob/main/README.md) for this list.

## Notes
** Most Coursera courses can be audited for free. From the enrollment page just choose the "audit" option when registering. When you audit a course you'll be able to see most of the course materials for free, but you won't be able to submit certain assessments or get grades for your work. You won't get a certificate, but you can pay for one at any time during or after the course. If you pay for a certificate, you may need to complete more coursework that wasn't available in the audit version.

*** Coursera specializations require a paid account, however you can enroll in the individual courses included in the specialization and audit those for free, see details above. To see the courses included in a specialization, click the "courses" tab on the specialization enrollment page.
